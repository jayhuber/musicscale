MUSICAL SCALE QUESTION TYPE

This question type deals with musical scales. The respondent is given a note and is prompted to enter the degrees of the scale. Major scales as well as all types of minor scales (natural, harmonic and melodic) are supported, with or without a key signature. Answers are entered in a graphical user interface.

Import/Export to Moodle XMl format is supported, and a question bank is provided, including all major and minor scales, with and without a key signature.
